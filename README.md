This is some arduino code for my watch project. Currently, there are two faces, an analog and a digital. It's super specific to the hardware I'm using, and also highly experimental. Also, it's not really very good code, since I'm not a c++ programmer by any stretch. However, it may be a good working example to extend and work from.
